## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### The larget variables/coefficients that provide for the variance are vehicle weight, mpg, and ground clearnace. Their t values were 13.566, 9.563, and -6.521, respectively.

### The slope can be considered zero. This is because all of the coefficients are roughly zero.

### Given the R-squared value of 0.7119, I would say that the model effectively predicts mpg of a MechaCar since the value is close to 1.
