## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### The larget variables/coefficients that provide for the variance are vehicle weight, mpg, and ground clearnace. Given that their p-values were less than 0.05, they have significance.

### Based on the low p-values and a significance of a few of the variables, you cannot say that the sope is zero.

### Given the R-squared value of 0.7119, I would say that the model effectively predicts mpg of a MechaCar since the value is close to 1.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### Looking at the variance, the total summary did not meet the design specifications, with a value of 62. However, the lot summary shows that Lots 1 and 2 would suffice, it is Lot 3 with a variance of 170 that caused the issue.
